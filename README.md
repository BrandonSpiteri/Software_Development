Three exercises submitted as follows:

# General Programming 
(Committed in Python 3.6)
1. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as a sequence of integers starting with 1 and 1, where each
subsequent value is the sum of the preceding two. I.e.
f(0) = 1
f(1) = 1
f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) where n >= 2
Write a program in a language of your choice to calculate the sum of the first 100 even-valued
Fibonacci numbers

2. Write a function in a language of your choice which, when passed two sorted arrays of integers
returns an array of any numbers which appear in both. No value should appear in the returned
array more than once.

3. Write a function in a language of your choice which, when passed a positive integer returns
true if the decimal representation of that integer contains no odd digits and otherwise returns
false.

4. Write a function in a language of your choice which, when passed a decimal digit X, returns the
value of X+XX+XXX+XXXX. E.g. if the supplied digit is 3 it should return 3702
(3+33+333+3333).


# Python Programming
1. Define a generator which generates the positive integers up to and including a supplied value
which are divisible by another supplied positive integer and use it to calculate the sum of all
positive integers less than 102030 which are divisible by 3

2. Write a function which is passed an integer, n, and returns a list of n lists such that:
f(0) returns []
f(1) returns [[1]]
f(2) returns [[1], [1,2]]
f(3) returns [[1], [1,2], [1,2,3]]
etc.

# C++ Programming
1. Implement a class with a member function 'int nobjs()' which returns the number of object
of that class currently in existence. What assumptions have you made?
